# mpvserve

The idea is to allow playing remove-stored videos with local `mpv`, just by clicking on a link in browser.  
Links have custom "mpv" URI-scheme, which should be handled by "wrapper".  

I picked is as a first rust project, so it's probably terrible, and I probably will revisit this a bunch of times later.
